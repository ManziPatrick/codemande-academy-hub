# Agile Project Management Guide

Welcome to the **CODEMANDE Academy** Agile Project Management system. This guide explains how to create, manage, and deliver projects using Agile methodologies within our platform.

## 1. Project Creation (The Backlog)
Projects are initiated by **Admins** or **Trainers**. A project represents a real-world problem or business objective designed to build a student's portfolio.

### Steps to Create a Project:
1.  **Navigate to Projects**: Go to the "Projects" tab in your Admin/Trainer Dashboard.
2.  **New Project**: Click on "Create Project" or "Assign Group Project".
3.  **Define Scope**:
    *   **Title**: Clear, descriptive name (e.g., "E-com Platform Revamp").
    *   **Description**: The "Product Vision". What are we building?
    *   **Repository URL**: Link to a Git repository template.
    *   **Deadline**: The final delivery date (The Release Date).

## 2. Team Formation & Agile Roles
Agile thrives on collaboration. When assigning a group project:
*   **Mentor (Product Owner/Scrum Master)**: Usually the Trainer or Admin who overseas the project.
*   **Students (Development Team)**: Interns assigned to build the project.
*   **Roles**: Interns should rotate roles like *Lead Developer*, *UI/UX Designer*, and *QA Engineer*.

## 3. Agile Workflow Implementation

### Sprints & Milestones
Instead of a monolithic delivery, break the project into stages:
1.  **Stage 1: Foundation**: Project setup, architecture, and basic UI.
2.  **Stage 2: Core Features**: Implementing the main business logic.
3.  **Stage 3: Refinement**: Testing, bug fixes, and polish.

### Daily Standups & Communication
Use the **Real-time Project Chat** for daily syncs:
*   **What did I do yesterday?**
*   **What will I do today?**
*   **Any blockers?**
Mentors should participate in these chats to provide instant guidance.

### Task Management (Kanban)
Each project has a task list where interns can:
*   Create small, actionable tasks.
*   Assign priorities (High, Medium, Low).
*   Track task completion.

## 4. Continuous Feedback & Review
Agile is iterative. Use the "Project Details" view to:
*   **Review Code**: Check the provided Repo URL.
*   **Provide Feedback**: Use the feedback box to suggest improvements *before* final submission.
*   **Iterate**: Allow interns to resubmit based on your feedback.

## 5. Project Graduation
Once all tasks are completed and the mentor approves:
1.  **Final Grading**: Assign a grade (A, B, C).
2.  **Certificate Issue**: Upon completion, students can receive specialized project badges or certificates.

*By following this Agile approach, we ensure our interns are not just coding, but learning how modern software teams function in the industry.*
